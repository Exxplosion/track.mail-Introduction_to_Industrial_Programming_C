THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN 



Neither the harps nor the crowns amused, nor the 

cherubs' dove-wingeJ races — 
Holding hands forlornly the Children wandered beneath 

the Dome; 
Plucking the radiant robes of the passers-by, and with 

pitiful faces 
Begging what Princes and Powers refused: — 'Ah, 

please will you let us go home ?' 

Over the jewelled floor, nigh weeping, ran to them 

Mary the Mother, 
Kneeled and caressed and made promise with kisses, 

and drew them along to the gateway — 
Yea, the all-iron unbribeable Door which Peter must 

guard and none other — 
Straightway She took the Keys from his keeping, and 

opened and freed them straightway. 

Then to Her Son, Who had seen and smiled. She said: 

* On the night that I bore Thee, 
What didst Thou care for a love beyond mine or a 

heaven that was not my arm ? 
Didst Thou push from the nipple, O Child, to hear 

the angels adore Thee ? 
When we two lay in the breath of the kine ? ' And 

He said: — 'Thou hast done no harm.' 



So through the Void the Children ran homeward 

merrily hand in hand. 
Looking neither to left nor right where the breathless 

Heavens stood still; 
And the Guards of the Void resheathed their swords, 

for they heard the Command: 
'Shall I that have suffered the children to come to me 

hold them against their will ? ' 



'THEY' 

"One view called me to another; one 
hill top to its fellow, half across the 
county, and since I could answer at no 
more trouble than the snapping forward 
of a lever, I let the county flow under 
my wheels. The orchid-studded flats 
of the East gave way to the thyme, ilex, 
and grey grass of the Downs; these 
again to the rich cornland and fig-trees 
of the lower coast, where you carry the 
beat of the tide on your left hand for 
fifteen level miles; and when, at last, 
I turned inland through a huddle of 
rounded hills and woods I had run my- 
self clean out of my known marks. 

7 



THEY' 8 

Beyond that precise hamlet which stands 
godmother to the capital of the United 
States, I found hidden villages where 
bees, the only things awake, boomed in 
eighty-foot lindens that overhung grey 
Norman churches; miraculous brooks 
diving under stone bridges built for 
heavier traffic than would ever vex them 
again; tithe-barns larger than their 
churches, and an old smithy that cried 
out aloud how it had once been a hall 
of the Knights of the Temple. Gipsies 
I met on a common where the gorse, 
brackens, and heath fought it out to- 
gether up a mile of Roman road; and 
a little farther on I disturbed a red fox 
rolling dog-fashion in the naked sun- 
light. 

As the wooded hills closed about me 
I stood up in the car to take the bear- 
ings of that great Down whose ringed 
head is a landmark for fifty miles across 



'THEY' 9 

the low countries. I judged that the 
lie of the country would bring me across 
some westward-running road that went 
to his feet, but I did not allow for the 
confusing veils of the woods. A quick 
turn plunged me first into a green cut- 
ting brim-full of liquid sunshine; next 
into a gloomy tunnel where last year's 
dead leaves whispered and scuffled 
about my tyres. The strong hazel stuff 
meeting overhead had not been cut for 
a couple of generations at least, nor had 
any axe helped the moss-cankered oak 
and beech to spring above them. Here 
the road changed frankly into a carpeted 
ride on whose brown velvet spent 
primrose- clumps showed like jade, and 
a few sickly, white-stalked blue-bells 
nodded together. As the slope favoured 
I shut off the power and slid over the 
whirled leaves, expecting every moment 
to meet a keeper; but I only heard a 



'THEY' lo 



jay, far off, arguing against the silence 
under the twilight of the trees. 

Still the track descended. I was on the 
point of reversing and working my way 
back as best I could ere I ended in some 
swamp, when I saw sunshine through 
the tangle ahead and lifted the brake. 

It was down again at once. As the 
light beat across my face my fore- wheels 
took the turf of a smooth still lawn from 
which sprang horsemen ten feet high 
with levelled lances, monstrous peacocks, 
and sleek round-headed maids of honour 
— blue, black, and glistening — all of 
clipped yew. Across the lawn — the mar- 
shalled woods besieged it on three sides 
— stood an ancient house of lichened and 
weather-worn stone, with mullioned win- 
dows and roofs of rose-red tile. It was 
flanked by semi-circular walls, also rose- 
red, that closed the lawn to the fourth 
side, and at their feet a box hedge grew 



'THEY' II 

man-high. There were doves on the 
roof about the shm brick chimneys, and 
I caught a glimpse of an octagonal dove- 
house behind the screening wall. 

Here, then, I stayed; a horseman's 
green spear laid at my breast; held by 
the exceeding beauty of that jewel in 
that setting. 

'If I am not packed off for a trespasser, 
or if this knight does not ride a wallop 
at me, ' thought I, 'Shakespeare and 
Queen Elizabeth will come out of that 
half-open garden door and ask me to 
tea. ' 

A child appeared at an upper window, 
and I thought the little thing waved a 
friendly hand. But it was to call a com- 
panion, for presently another bright 
head showed. Then I heard a laugh 
among the yew-peacocks, and turning to 
make sure (till then I had been watching 
the house only) saw the silver of a foun- 



'THEY' 12 

tain behind a hedge thrown up against 
the sun. The doves on the roof cooed 
to the cooing water; but between the 
two notes I caught the utterly happy 
chuckle of a child absorbed in some 
light mischief. 

The garden door — heavy oak sunk deep 
in the thickness of the wall — opened 
further: a woman in a big garden hat 
set her foot slowly on the time-hollowed 
stone steps and slowly walked across 
the turf. I was forming some apology 
when she lifted her head and I saw that 
she was blind. 

'I heard you, ' she said. 'Isn't that 
a motor car?' 

'I'm afraid I've made a mistake in my 
road. I should have turned off up 
above — I never dreamed ' I began. 

'But I'm very glad. Fancy a motor 
car coming into the garden! It will be 
such a treat ' She turned and made 




SHE TURNF.D AND MADK AS THOUGH LOOKINCi AIJOUT HER. 



'THEY' 14 

as though looking about her. 'You — 
you haven't seen any one, have you — 
perhaps ? ' 

'No one to speak to, but the children 
seemed interested at a distance. ' 

'Which?' 

'I saw a couple up at the window just 
now, and I think I heard a little chap in 
the grounds. ' 

'Oh, lucky you!' she cried, and her 
face brightened. 'I hear them, of course, 
but that's all. You've seen them and 
heard them?' 

'Yes, ' I answered. 'And if I know 
anything of children, one of them's 
having a beautiful time by the fountain 
yonder. Escaped, I imagine. ' 

'Your're fond of children? ' 

I gave her one or two reasons why I 
did not altogether hate them. 

'Of course, of course, ' she said. 'Then 
you understand. Then you won't think 



•THEY' 15 

it foolish if I ask you to take your 
car through the gardens, once or twice 
— quite slowly? I'm sure they'd like 
to see it. They see so little, poor things. 
One tries to make their life pleasant, 
but ' she threw out her hands to- 
wards the woods. 'We're so out of the 
world here. ' 

That will be splendid, ' I said. 'But 
I mustn't cut up your grass. ' 

She faced to the right. 'Wait a 
minute, ' said she. 'We 're at the South 
gate, aren't we? Behind those peacocks 
there's a flagged path. We call it the 
Peacocks * Walk. You can't see it from 
here, they tell me, but if you squeeze 
along by the edge of the wood you can 
turn at the first peacock and get on to 
the flags. ' 

It was sacrilege to wake that dream- 
ing house-front with the clatter of ma- 
chinery, but I swung the car to clear the 



THEY' i6 

turf, brushed along the edge of the wood 
and turned in on the broad stone path 
where the fountain-basin lay like one 
star-sapphire. 

'May I come too?' she cried. 'No, 
please don't help me. They'll like it 
better if they see me. ' 

She felt her way lightly to the front 
of the car, and with one foot on the step 
she called: 'Children, oh, children! Look 
and see what's going to happen! ' 

The voice would have drawn lost souls 
from the Pit, for the yearning that under- 
lay its sweetness, and I was not surprised 
to hear an answering shout behind the 
yews. It must have been the child by 
the fountain, but he fled at our approach, 
leaving a little toy boat in the water. I 
saw the glint of his blue blouse among 
the still horsemen. 

Very disposedly we paraded the length 
of the walk and at her request backed

again. This time the child had got the 
better of his panic, but stood far off and 
doubting. 

'The Httle fellow's watching us, ' I 
said. 'I wonder if he'd like a ride. ' 

'They're very shy still. Very shy. 
But, oh, lucky you to be able to see 
them! Let's listen. ' 

I stopped the machine at once, and 
the humid stillness, heavy with the 
scent of box, cloaked us deep. Shears 
I could hear where some gardener was 
clipping, a mumble of bees, and broken 
voices that might have been the doves. 

'Oh, unkind!' she said weariedly. 

'Perhaps they're only shy of the motor. 
That little maid at the window looks 
tremendously interested. ' 

'Yes?' She raised her head. 'It was 
wrong of me to say that. They are 
really fond of me. It's the only thing 
that makes life worth living — when 



'THEY' 19 

they're fond of you, isnt' it? I 
daren't think what the place would 
be without them. By the way, is it 
beautiful ? ' 

'I think it is the most beautiful place 
I have ever seen. ' 

'So they all tell me. I can feel it, of 
course, but that isn't quite the same 
thing. ' 

'Then have you never ?' I be- 
gan, but stopped abashed. 

'Not since I can remember. It hap- 
pened when I was only a few months old, 
they tell me. And yet I must remember 
something, else how could I dream about 
colours. I see light in my dreams, and 
colours, but I never see them. I only 
hear them, just as I do when I'm 
awake. ' 

'It's difficult to see faces in dreams. 
Some people can, but most of us haven't 
the gift, ' I went on, looking up at the 



THEY' 20 

window where the child stood all but 
hidden. 

'I've heard that too,' she said. 'And 
they tell me that one never sees a dead 
person's face in a dream. Is that true?' 

'I believe it is — now I come to think 
of it. ' 

'But how is it with yourself — your- 
self?' The blind eyes turned towards 
me. 

'I have never seen the faces of my dead 
in any dream, ' I answered. 

'Then it must be as bad as being 
blind. ' 

The sun had dipped behind the woods 
and the long shades were possessing the 
insolent horsemen one by one. I saw 
the light die from off the top of a glossy- 
leaved lance and all its brave hard green 
turn to soft black. The house, accepting 
another day at end, as it had accepted 
an hundred thousand gone, seemed to 



J 



'THEY' 21 

settle deeper into its rest among the 
shadows. 

'Have you ever wanted to?' she said 
after the silence. 

'Very much sometimes, ' I replied. 
The child had left the window as the 
shadows shut upon it. 

'Ah! So've I, but I don't suppose 

it's allowed Where d'you 

live?' 

'Quite the other side of the county 
— sixty miles and more, and I must be 
going back. I've come without my big 
lamps.' 

'But it's not dark yet. I can 
feel it.' 

'I'm afraid it will be by the time I get 
home. Could you lend me some one to 
set me on my road at first? I've utterly 
lost myself. ' 

'I'll send Madden with you to the 
cross-roads. We are so out of the world, 



^THEY' 22 

I don't wonder you were lost. I'll 
guide you round to the front of the house ; 
but you will go slowly, won't you, till 
you're out of the grounds? It isn't 
foolish, do you think?' 

'I promise you I'll go like this,' I said, 
and let the car start herself down the 
flagged path. 

We skirted the left wing of the house, 
whose elaborately cast lead guttering 
alone was worth a day's journey; passed 
under a great rose-grown gate in the red 
wall, and so round to the high front of 
the house which in beauty and state- 
liness as much excelled the back as that 
all others I had seen. 

'Is it so very beautiful?' she said 
wistfully when she heard my raptures. 
'And you like the lead-figures too? 
There's the old azalea garden behind. 
They say that this place must have been 
made for children. Will you help me 



'THEY ' 23 

out, please? I should like to come with 
you as far as the cross-roads, but 
I mustn't leave them. Is that you, 
Madden? I want you to show this 
gentleman the way to the cross-roads. 
He has lost his way but — he has seen 
them.' 

A butler appeared noiselessly at the 
miracle of old oak that must be called 
the front door, and slipped aside to put 
on his hat. She stood looking at me 
with open blue eyes in which no sight 
lay; and I saw for the first time that she 
was beautiful. 

'Remember, ' she said quietly, 'if 
you are fond of them you will come 
again, ' and disappeared within the 
house. 

The butler in the car said nothing till 
we were nearly at the lodge gates, where 
catching a glimpse of a blue blouse in a 
shrubbery I swerved amply lest the devil 




I SWKRVED AMPLY LEST THE DEVIL THAT LEADS LITTLE BOYS TO I'l.AY SHOULD 
DRAt; ME INTO CHILD-.MURDEK. 



THEY' 25 

that leads little boys to play should drag 
me into child-murder. 

'Excuse me, ' he asked of a sudden, 
'but why did you do that, Sir? ' 

'The child yonder. ' 

'Our young gentleman in blue?' 

'Of course. ' 

'He runs about a good deal. Did you 
see him by the fountain, Sir?' 

'Oh, yes, several times. Do we turn 
here?' 

'Yes, Sir. And did you 'appen to see 
them upstairs too ? ' 

'At the upper window? Yes.' 

'Was that before the mistress come 
out to speak to you. Sir? ' 

'A little before that. Why d'you 
want to know?' 

He paused a little. 'Only to make 
sure that — that they had seen the car. 
Sir, because with children running about, 
though I'm sure you're driving partic- 



'THEY' 26 

ularly careful, there might be an accident. 
That was all, Sir. Here are the cross- 
roads. You can't miss you way from 
now on. Thank you. Sir, but that isn't 
our custom, not with ' 

'I beg your pardon, ' I said, and 
thrust away the British silver. 

'Oh, it's quite right with the rest of 
'em as a rule. Good-bye, Sir. ' 

He retired into the armour-plated 
conning-tower of his caste and walked 
away. Evidently a butler solicitous 
for the honour of the house, and in- 
terested, probably through a maid, in 
its nursery. 

Once beyond the signposts at the 
cross-roads I looked back, but the 
crumpled hills interlaced so jealously 
that I could not see where the house had 
lain. When I asked its name at a cot- 
tage along the road, the fat woman who 
sold sweetmeats there gave me to under- 



THEY' 27 

stand that people with motor cars have 
small right to live — much less to 'go 
about talking like carriage folk. ' They 
were not a pleasant-mannered com- 
munity. 

As I retraced my run on the 
map that evening I was a little wiser. 
Hawkin's Old Farm appeared to be 
the Survey title of the place, and the 
old County Gazetteer, generally so 
ample, did not allude to it. The big 
house of those parts was Hodnington 
Hall, Georgian with early Victorian 
embellishments, as an atrocious steel 
engraving attested. I carried my diffi- 
culty to a neighbour — a deep-rooted 
tree of that soil — and he gave me a 
name of a family which conveyed no 
meaning. 

A month or so later I went again — 
or it may have been that my car 
took the road of her own volition. She 



'THEY' 28 

over-ran the fruitless Downs, threaded 
every turn of the maze of lanes below 
the hills, drew through the high- walled 
woods, impenetrable in their full leaf, 
came out at the cross-roads where the 
butler had left me, and a little farther 
on developed an internal trouble which 
forced me to turn her in on a grass 
way- waste that cut into a summer- silent 
hazel wood. So far as I could make 
sure by the sun and a six-inch Ordnance 
map, this should be the road-flank of 
that wood which I had first explored 
from the heights above. I made a 
mighty serious business of my repairs 
and a glittering shop of my repair-kit, 
spanners, pump, and the like, which I 
spread out orderly upon a rug. It was 
a trap to catch all childhood, for on 
such a day, I argued, the children would 
not be far off. When I paused in my 
work I listened, but the wood was so 




IT W A> A TKAF- I' 



I CAICH At.I. LHIl.llHi " 111. FiU; 1 'N SICK A HAY. 
THE CHILDREN WOULD NOT BE FAR OFF. 



THEY' 30 

full of the noises of summer (though the 
birds had mated) that I could not at 
first distinguish these from the tread of 
small cautious feet stealing across the 
dead leaves. I rang my bell in an allur- 
ing manner, but the feet fled, and I 
repented, for to a child a sudden noise 
is very real terror. I must have been 
at work half an hour when I heard in 
the wood the voice of the blind woman 
crying: 'Children, oh, children! Where 
are you?' and the stillness made slow to 
close on the perfection of that cry. She 
came towards me, half feeling her way 
between the tree-boles, and though a 
child, it seemed, clung to her skirt, it 
swerved into the leafage like a rabbit as 
she drew nearer. 

'Is that you?' she said. 'From the 
other side of the county?' 

'Yes, it's me — from the other side of 
the county. ' 



THEY' 31 

'Then why didn't you come through 
the upper woods? They were there 
just now. ' 

'They were here a few minutes ago. 
I expect they knew my car had broken 
down, and came to see the fun. ' 

'Nothing serious, I hope? How do 
cars break down?' 

'In fifty different ways. Only mine 
has chosen the fifty first. ' 

She laughed merrily at the tiny joke, 
cooed with delicious laughter, and pushed 
her hat back. 

'Let me hear, ' she said. 

'Wait a moment, ' I cried, 'and I'll 
get you a cushion. ' 

She set her foot on the rug all 
covered with spare parts, and stooped 
above it eagerly. What delightful 
things!' The hands through which she 
saw glanced in the chequered sun- 
light. 'A box here — another box! 



I 



'THEY' 32 

Why you've arranged them Uke play- 
ing shop!' 

'I confess now that I put it out to 
attract them. I don't need half those 
things really. ' 

'How nice of you! I heard your bell 
in the upper wood. You say they were 
here before that?' 

'I'm sure of it. Why are they so shy? 
That little fellow in blue who was with 
you just now ought to have got over his 
fright. He's been watching me like a 
Red Indian. ' 

'It must have been your bell, ' she 
said. 'I heard one of them go past me 
in trouble when I was coming down. 
They're shy — so shy even with me. ' 
She turned her face over her shoulder 
and cried again: 'Children, oh, children! 
Look and see ! ' 

'They must have gone off together 
on their own affairs, ' I suggested, for 



i 




"why VllU'VE ARRANGED THF.M I.IKE I'LAYIXG SIlOl' ! " 



'THEY' 34 

there was a murmur behind us of 
lowered voices broken by the sudden 
squawking giggles of childhood. I re- 
turned to my tinkerings and she leaned 
forward, her chin on her hand, listening 
interestedly. 

'How many are they?' I said at last. 
My work was finished, but I saw no 
reason to go. 

Her forehead puckered a little in 
thought. 'I don't quite know, 'she said 
simply. 'Sometimes more — sometimes 
less. They come and stay with me 
because I love them, you see. ' 

'That must be very jolly, ' I said, re- 
placing a drawer, and as I spoke I heard 
the inanity of my answer. 

'You — you aren't laughing at me, ' 
she cried. T — I haven't any of my own. 
I never married. People laugh at me 
sometimes about them because — be- 
cause — ' 



1 



'THEY' 



35 



'Because they're savages, ' I returned. 
'It's nothing to fret for. That sort 
laugh at everything that isn't in their 
own fat lives. * 

*I don't know. How should I? I 
only don't like being laughed at about 
them. It hurts; and when one can't 
see. ... I don't want to seem silly, ' 
her chin quivered like a child's as she 
spoke, 'but we blindies have only one 
skin, I think. Ever3rthing outside hits 
straight at our souls. It's different with 
you. You've such good defences in 
your eyes — looking out — before any one 
can really pain you in your soul. People 
forget that with us. ' 

I was silent reviewing that inexhaust- 
ible matter — the more than inherited 
(since it is also carefully taught) brutality 
of the Christian peoples, beside which 
the mere heathendom of the West 
Coast nigger is clean and restrained. 



1 



THEY' 36 

It led me a long distance into my- 
self. 

'Don't do that!' she said of a sudden, 
putting her hands before her eyes. 

'What?' 

She made a gesture with her hand. 

'That! It's — it's all purple and black. 
Don't! That colour hurts. ' 

'But, how in the world do you know 
about colours?' I exclaimed, for here 
was a revelation indeed. 

'Colours as colours?' she asked. 

'No. Those Colours which you saw 
just now.' 

'You know as well as I do, ' she 
laughed, 'else you wouldn't have asked 
that question. They aren't in the world 
at all. They're in you — when you went 
so angry. 

'D 'you mean dull purplish patches, 
like port wine mixed with inki*' I said. 

'I've never seen ink or port wine, but 



1 



THEY' 37 

the colours aren't mixed. They are 
separate — all separate. ' 

'Do you mean black streaks and jags 
across the purple ? ' 

She nodded. 'Yes — if they are like 
this, ' and zig-zagged her finger again, 
'but it's more red than purple — that 
bad colour. ' 

'And what are the colours at the top 
of the — whatever you see?' 

Slowly she leaned forward and traced 
on the rug the figure of the Egg itself. 

'I see them so, ' she said, pointing 
with a grass stem, 'white, green, yellow, 
red, purple, and when people are angry 
or bad, black across the red — as you were 
just now. ' 

'Who told you anything about it — 
in the beginning ? ' I demanded. 

'About the Colours? No one. I used 
to ask what colours were when I was 
little — in table-covers and curtains 



THEY' 38 

and carpets, you see — because some 
colours hurt me and some made me 
happy. People told me; and when I 
got older that was how I saw people. ' 
Again she traced the outline of the Egg 
which it is given to very few of us to 
see. 

'All by yourself ? ' I repeated. 

'All by myself. There wasn't any 
one else. I only found out afterwards 
that other people did not see the 
Colours. ' 

She leaned against the tree-bole plait- 
ing and unplaiting chance- plucked grass 
stems. The children in the wood had 
drawn nearer. I could see them, with 
the tail of my eye, frolicking like 
squirrels. 

'Now I am sure you will never laugh 
at me, ' she went on after a long silence. 
'Nor at them. ' 

'Goodness — no!' I cried, jolted out 



THEY' 39 

of my train of thought. 'A man who 
laughs at a child — unless the child is 
laughing too — is a heathen ! ' 

*I didn't mean that, of course. You'd 
never laugh at children, but I thought — 
I used to think — that perhaps you might 
laugh about them. So now I beg your 
pardon. . . . What are you going 
to laugh at?' 

I had made no sound, but she 
knew. 

'At the notion of your begging my 
pardon. If you had done your duty as 
a pillar of the State and a landed pro- 
prietress you ought to have summoned 
me for trespass when I barged through 
your woods the other day. It was dis- 
graceful of me— inexcusable. ' 

She looked at me, her head against 
the tree trunk — long and steadfastly — 
this woman who could see the naked 
soul. 



THEY' 40 

'How curious, ' she half whispered. 
'How very curious. ' 

'Why, what have I done?' 

'You don't understand . . . and 
yet you understood about the Colours. 
Don't you understand?' 

She spoke with a passion that nothing 
had justified, and I faced her bewild- 
eredly as she rose. The children had 
gathered themselves in a roundel behind 
a bramble bush. One sleek head bent 
over something smaller, and the set of 
the little shoulders told me that fingers 
were on lips. They, too, had some 
child's tremendous secret. I alone was 
hopelessly astray there in the broad sun- 
light. 

'No, ' I said, and shook my head as 
though the dead eyes could note. 'What 
ever it is, I don't understand yet. Per- 
haps I shall later — if you'll let me come 
again. ' 



THEY ' 41 

'You will come again, ' she answered. 
'You will surely come again and walk 
in the wood. ' 

'Perhaps the children will know me 
well enough by that time to let me play 
with them — as a favour. You know 
what children are like. ' 

'It isn't a matter of favour but of 
right, ' she replied, and while I wondered 
what she meant, a dishevelled woman 
plunged round the bend of the road, 
loose-haired, purple, almost lowing with 
agony as she ran. It was my rude, fat 
friend of the sweetmeat shop. The 
blind woman heard and stepped forward. 
'What is it, Mrs. Madehurst?' she 
asked. 

The woman flung her apron over her 
head and literally grovelled in the dust, 
crying that her grandchild was sick to 
death, that the local doctor was away 
fishing, that Jenny the mother was at 




the woman fi.ung 111- n aik-dn ()\hk hi-.r head am) ].l i er ally 
c;kovelled in the dust. 



THEY' 43 

her wits' end, and so forth, with repe- 
titions and bellowings. 

'Where's the next nearest doctor?' 
I asked between paroxysms. 

'Madden will tell you. Go round to 
the house and take him with you. I'll 
attend to this. Be quick!' She half 
supported the fat woman into the shade. 
In two minutes I was blowing all the 
horns of Jericho under the front of the 
House Beautiful, and Madden, from the 
pantry, rose to the crisis like a butler 
and a man. 

A quarter of an hour at illegal 
speeds caught us a doctor five miles 
away. Within the half-hour we had 
decanted him, much interested in 
motors, at the door of the sweetmeat 
shop, and drew up the road to await 
the verdict. 

'Useful things cars, ' said Madden, all 
man and no butler. 'If I'd had one 



THEY' 44 

when mine took sick she wouldn't have 
died. ' 

'How was it?' I asked. 

'Croup. Mrs. Madden was away. No 
one knew what to do. I drove eight 
miles in a tax-cart for the doctor. She 
was choked when we came back. This 
car 'd ha' saved her. She'd have been 
close on ten now. ' 

'I'm sorry, ' I said. 'I thought you 
were rather fond of children from what 
you told me going to the cross-roads the 
other day. ' 

'Have you seen 'em again, Sir — this 
mornin' ? ' 

"Yes, but they're well broke to cars. 
I couldn't get any of them within twenty 
yards of it. ' 

He looked at me carefully as a scout 
considers a stranger — not as a menial 
should lift his eyes to his divinely ap- 
pointed superior. 



'THEY' 45 

/ *I wonder why, ' he said just above 
'the breath that he drew. 

We waited on. A Hght wind from 
the sea faltered up and down the long 
lines of the woods, and the wayside 
grasses, whitened already with sum- 
mer dust, rose and bowed in sallow 
waves. 

A woman wiping, the suds off her arms, 
came out of the cottage next the sweet- 
meat shop. 

'I've be'n listenin' in de back-yard, ' 
she said cheerilx. 'He says Arthur's 
unaccountable bad. Did ye hear him 
shruck just now? Unaccountable bad. 
I reckon t'will come Jenny's turn to 
walk in de wood nex' week along, Mr. 
Madden. ' 

'Excuse me. Sir, but your lap-robe 
is slipping, ' said Madden deferentially. 
The woman started, dropped a curtsey, 
and hurried away. 



'THEY' 46 

'What does she mean by "walking 
in the wood? " ' I asked. 

'It must be some saying they use 
hereabouts. I'm from Norfolk myself, ' 
said Madden. 'They're an independent 
lot in this country. She took you for a 
chauffeur, Sir. ' 

I saw the Doctor come out of the cot- 
tage followed by a draggle-tailed wench 
who clung to his arm as though he could 
make treaty for her with Death. 'Dat 
sort, ' she wailed — 'dey're just as much 
to us dat has 'em as if dey was lawful 
bom. Just as much^ust as much! 
An' God he'd be just as pleased if you 
saved 'un. Doctor. Don't take it from 
me. Miss Florence will tell ye de very 
same. Don't leave 'im. Doctor!' 

'I know, I know,' said the man; 'but 
he'll be quite for a while now. We'll 
get the nurse and the medicine as fast 
as we can. ' He signalled me to come

forward with the car and I strove not 
to be privy to what followed. But I 
saw the girls' face, blotched and frozen 
with grief, and I felt the hand without 
a ring clutching at my knees when we 
moved away. 

The Doctor was a man of some humour, 
for I remember he claimed my car under 
the Oath of ^sculapius, and used it and 
me without mercy. First we convoyed 
Mrs. Madehurst and the blind woman to 
wait by the sick bed till the nurse should 
come. Next we invaded a neat county 
town for prescriptions (the Doctor said 
the trouble was cerebro-spinal menin- 
gitis), and when the County Institute, 
banked and flanked with scared market 
cattle, reported itself out of nurses for the 
moment we literally flung ourselves loose 
upon the county. We conferred with 
the owners of great houses — magnates 
at the ends of overarching avenues whose 




THEY' 49 

big-boned womenfolk strode away from 
their tea-tables to listen to the imperious 
Doctor. At last a white-haired lady- 
sitting under a cedar of Lebanon and 
surrounded by a court of magnificent 
orzois — all hostile to motors — gave the 
Doctor, who received them as from a 
princess, written orders which we bore 
many miles at top speed, through a park, 
to a French nunnery, where we took 
over in exchange a pallid-faced and 
trembling Sister. She knelt at the bot- 
tom of the tonneau telling her beads 
without pause till, by short-cuts of the 
Doctor's invention, we had her to the 
sweetmeat shop once more. It was a 
long afternoon crowded with mad epi- 
sodes that rose and dissolved like the dust 
of our wheels; cross-sections of remote 
and incomprehensible lives through which 
we raced at right angles; and I went 
home in the dusk, wearied out, to dream 




AT LAST A WHITK-HAIKED l.ADY SITTING UNDER A CliDAR OF LUISANON. 



'THEY' 51 

of the clashing horns of cattle; round- 
eyed nuns walking in a garden of graves ; 
pleasant tea-parties beneath shaded trees ; 
the carbolic-scented, grey-painted cor- 
ridors of the County Institute; the steps 
of shy children in the wood, and the hands 
that clung to my knees as the motor be- 
gan to move. 



I had intended to return in a day or 
two, but it pleased Fate to hold me from 
that side of the county, on many pre- 
texts, till the elder and the wild rose had 
fruited. There came at last a brilliant 
day, swept clear from the southwest, 
that brought the hills within hand's 
reach — a day of unstable airs and high 
filmy clouds. Through no merit of my 
own I was free, and set the car for the 
the third time on that known road. As 
I reached the crest of the Downs I felt 



THEY' 52 

the soft air change, saw it glaze under 
the sun; and, looking down at the sea, 
in that instant beheld the blue of the 
Channel turn through polished silver and 
dulled steel to dingy pewter. A laden 
collier hugging the coast steered out- 
ward for deeper water, and, across copper- 
coloured haze, I saw sails rise one by one 
on the anchored fishing-fleet. In a deep 
dene behind me an eddy of sudden wind 
drummed through sheltered oaks, and 
spun aloft the first dry sample of autumn 
leaves. When I reached the beach road 
the sea-fog fumed over the brickfields, 
and the tide was telling all the groins of 
the gale beyond Ushant. In less than 
an hour summer England vanished in 
chill grey. We were again the shut 
island of the North, all the ships of the 
world bellowing at our perilous gates; 
and between their outcries ran the piping 



'THEY' 53 

of bewildered gulls. My cap dripped 
moisture, the folds of the rug held it in 
pools or sluiced it away in runnels, and 
the salt-rime stuck to my lips. 

Inland the smell of autumn loaded the 
thickened fog among the trees, and the 
drip became a continuous shower. Yet 
the late flowers — mallow of the wayside, 
scabious of the field, and dahlia of the 
garden — showed gay in the mist, and 
beyond the sea's breath there was little 
sign of decay in the leaf. Yet in the 
villages of the house the doors were all 
open, and bare-legged, bare-headed child- 
ren sat at ease on the damp doorsteps to 
shout 'pip-pip' at the stranger. 

I made bold to call at the sweetmeat 
shop, where Mrs. Madehurst met me 
with a fat woman's hospitable tears. 
Jenny's child, she said, had died two 
days after the nun had come. It was, 
she felt, best out of the w^ay, even though 



'THEY' 54 

insurance offices, for reasons which she 
did not pretend to follow, would not 
willingly insure such stray lives. 'Not 
but what Jenny didn't tend to Arthur 
as though he'd come all proper at de end 
of de first year — like Jenny herself. ' 
Thanks to Miss Florence, the child had 
been buried with a pomp, which, in Mrs. 
Madehurst's opinion, more than covered 
the small irregularity of its birth. She 
described the coffin, within and without, 
the glass hearse, and the evergreen lining 
of the grave. 

'But how's the mother?' I asked. 

'Jenny? Oh, she'll get over it. I've 
felt dat way with one or two o' my own. 
She'll get over. She's walkin' in de 
wood now. ' 

'In this weather?' 

Mrs. Madehurst looked at me with 
narrowed eyes across the counter. 

*I dunno but it opens de 'eart like. 




•' I DUNNO nUT IT Ol'ENS HE 'eAKT I.IKE. VES, IT OI'ENS DE EAKT. 



THEY' 56 

Yes, it opens de 'eart. Dat's where 
losin' and bearin' comes so alike in de 
long run, we do say. ' 

Now the wisdom of the old wives is 
greater than that of all the Fathers, and 
this last oracle sent me thinking so ex- 
tendedly as I went up the road, that I 
nearly ran over a woman and a child at 
the wooded corner by the lodge gates 
of the House Beautiful. 

'Awful weather!' I cried, as I slowed 
dead for the turn. 

'Not so bad, ' she answered placidly 
out of the fog. 'Mine's used to 
'un. You'll find yours indoors, I 
reckon. ' 

Indoors, Madden received me with 
professional courtesy, and kind inquiries 
for the health of the motor, which he 
would put under cover. 

I waited in a still, nut-brown hall, 
pleasant with late flowers and warmed 



THEY' 57 

with a delicious wood fire — a place of 
good influence and great peace. (Men 
and women may sometimes, after great 
effort, achieve a creditable lie; but the 
house, which is their temple, cannot 
tell anything save the truth of those 
who have lived in it.) A child's cart 
and a doll lay on the black-and-white 
floor, where a rug had been kicked back. 
I felt that the children had only just 
hurried away — to hide themselves, most 
like, in the many turns of the great 
adz ed staircase that climbed statelily 
out of the hall, or to crouch at gaze 
behind the lions and roses of the carven 
gallery above. Then I heard her voice 
above me, singing as the blind sing — 
from the soul: — 

In the pleasant orchard-closes 

And all my early summer came back at 
the call. 



'THEY' 58 

In the pleasant orchard-closes, 
God bless all our gains, say we — 

But may God bless all our losses, 
Better suits with our degree. 

She dropped the marring fifth line, and 
repeated — 

Better suits with our degree! 

I saw her lean over the gallery, her 
Hnked hands white as pearl against the 
oak. 

'Is that you — from the other side of 
the county? ' she called. 

'Yes, me — from the other side of the 
county, ' I answered, laughing. 

'What a long time before you had to 
come here again. ' She ran down the 
stairs, one hand lightly touching the 
broad rail. 'It's two months and four 
days. Summer's gone!' 

'I meant to come before, but Fate 
prevented. * 



THEY' 59 

'I knew it. Please do something to 
that fire. They won't let me play with 
it, but I can feel it's behaving badly. 
Hit it!' 

I looked on either side of the deep 
fireplace, and found but a half-charred 
hedge-stake with which I punched a black 
log into flame. 

'It never goes out, day or night, ' she 
said, as though explaining. 'In case 
any one comes in with cold toes, you 
see. ' 

'It's even lovelier inside than it was 
out, ' I murmured. The red light 
poured itself along the age- polished 
dusky panels till the Tudor roses and 
lions of the gallery took colour and 
motion. An old eagle-topped convex 
mirror gathered the picture into its 
mysterious heart, distorting afresh the 
distorted shadows, and curving the 
gallery lines into the curves of a ship. 



THEY' 60 

The day was shutting down in half a 
gale as the fog turned to stringy scud. 
Through the uncurtained mullions of 
the broad window I could see the valiant 
horsemen of the lawn rear and recover 
against the wind that pelted them with 
legions of dead leaves. 

'Yes, it must be beautiful, ' she said. 
'Would you like to go over it? There's 
still light enough upstairs. ' 

I followed her up the unflinching, 
wagon-wide staircase to the gallery 
whence opened the thin fluted Eliza- 
bethan doors. 

'Feel how they put the latches low 
down for the sake of the children, ' She 
swung a light door inward. 

'By the way, where are they?' I 
asked. 'I haven't even heard them 
to-day. ' 

She did not answer at once. Then, 
'I can only hear them, ' she replied softly. 



'THEY' 6i 

'This is one of their rooms — everything 
ready, you see. ' 

She pointed into a heavily-timbered 
room. There were Httle low gate-tables 
and children's chairs. A doll's house, 
its hooked front half open, faced a 
great dappled rocking-horse, from whose 
padded saddle it was but a child's 
scramble to the broad window-seat 
overlooking the lawn. A toy gun 
lay in a corner beside a gilt wooden 
cannon. 

'Surely they've only just gone, ' I 
whispered. In the failing light a door 
creaked cautiously. I heard the rustle 
of a frock and the patter of feet — quick 
feet through a room beyond. 

*I heard that! ' she cried triumphantly. 
'Did you? Children, oh, children! Where 
are you?' 

The voice filled the walls that held it 
lovingly to the last perfect note, but 




THIS IS <i\i-: iiF TiiF.iR KdoMs i;vi:i;vTMiN(; kkady vou sue. 



'THEY' 63 

there came no answering shout such as 
I had heard in the garden. We hurried 
on from room to oak-floored room; up 
a step here, down three steps there; 
among a maze of passages; always 
mocked by our quarry. One might as 
well have tried to work an unstopped 
warren with a single ferret. There 
were bolt-holes innumerable — recesses in 
walls, embrasures of deep-slitten win- 
dows now filled up, whence they could 
start up behind us ; and abandoned fire- 
places, six feet deep in the masonry, as 
well as the tangle of communicating 
doors. Above all, they had the twilight 
for their helper in our game. I had 
caught one or two joyous chuckles of 
evasion, and once or twice had seen the 
silhouette of a child's frock against some 
darkening window at the end of a pas- 
sage; but we returned empty-handed 
to the gallery, just as a middle-aged 



'THEY' 64 

woman was setting a lamp in its 
niche. 

*No, I haven't seen her either this 
evening, Miss Florence, * I heard her 
say, 'but that Turpin he says he wants 
to see you about his shed. ' 

'Oh, Mr. Turpin must want to see me 
very badly. Tell him to come to the 
hall, Mrs. Madden. ' 

I looked down into the hall whose 
only light was the dulled fire; and deep 
in the shadow I saw them at last. They 
must have slipped down while we were 
in the passages, and now thought them- 
selves perfectly hidden behind an old 
gilt leather screen. By child's law, my 
fruitless chase was as good as an intro- 
duction, but since I had taken so much 
trouble, I resolved to force them to 
come forward later by the trick, which 
children detest, of pretending not to 
notice them. They lay close, in a little 




riii':v Mrsr iia\':-: 



I W \ Willi 



Mil-; [•.\.s-<Av,l-. 



'THEY' 66 

huddle, no more than shadows except 
when a quick flame betrayed a small 
outline. 

'And now we'll have some tea, ' she 
said. 'I believe I ought' to have offered 
it you at first, but one doesn't arrive at 
manners somehow when one lives alone 
and is considered — h'm — peculiar.* Then 
with a very pretty scorn, 'Would you 
like a lamp to see to eat by?' 

'The firelight's much pleasanter, I 
think. ' We descended into that deli- 
cious gloom and Madden brought tea. 

I took my chair in the direction of 
the screen ready to surprise or be sur- 
prised as the game should go, and at 
her permission, since the hearth is always 
sacred, bent forward to play with the fire. 

'Where do you get these beautiful 
short fagots from ? ' I asked idly. 'Why, 
they are tallies ! ' 

'Of course, ' she replied. 'As I can't 



THEY ' 68 

read or write I'm driven back on the 
early English tally for my accounts. 
Give me one and I'll tell you what it 
meant. ' 

I passed her an unburned hazel-tally, 
about a foot long, and she ran her thumb 
down the nicks. 

'This is the milk- record for the home 
farm for the month of April last year, 
in gallons, ' said she. *I don't know 
what I should have done without tallies. 
An old forester of mine taught me the 
system. It's out of date now for every 
one else; but my tenants respect it. 
One of them's coming now to see me. 
Oh, it doesn't matter. He has no busi- 
ness here out of office hours. He's 
a greedy, ignorant man — very greedy 
or — he wouldn't come here after 
dark. ' 

'Have you much land then?* 

'Only a couple of hundred acres in 



THEY' 69 

hand, thank goodness. The other six 
hundred are nearly all let to folk who 
knew my folk before me; but this Tur- 
pin is quite a new man — and a highway 
robber. ' 

'But are you sure I shan't be ?* 

'Certainly not. You have the right. 
He hasn't* any children. ' 

'Ah, the children!' I said, and slid 
my low chair back till it nearly touched 
the screen that hid them. 'I wonder 
whether they'll come out for me. ' 

There was a murmur of voices — 
Madden' s and a deeper note — at the low, 
dark side door, and a ginger-headed, 
canvas-gaitered giant of the unmistak- 
able tenant-farmer type stumbled or 
was pushed in. 

'Come to the fire, Mr. Turpin, ' she 
said. 

'If — if you please, Miss, I'll — I'll be 
quite as well by the door. ' He clung 



THEY' 70 

to the latch as he spoke like a frightened 
child. Of a sudden I realized that he 
was in the grip of some almost over- 
powering fear. 

'Well?' . 

'About that new shed for the young 
stock — that was all. These first au- 
tumn storms settin' in . . . but I'll 
come again, Miss. ' His teeth did not 
chatter much more than the door-latch. 

'I think not, she answered, levelly. 
The new shed — m'm. What did my 
agent write you on the 15th?' 

'I — fancied p'raps that if I came to 
see you — ma — man to man like, Miss. 
But ' 

His eyes rolled into every corner of 
the room wide with horror. He half 
opened the door through which he had 
entered, but I noticed that it was shut 
again — from without and firmly. 

'He wrote what I told him, ' she 



THEY' 71 

went on. 'You are overstocked al- 
ready. Dunnett's Farm never carried 
more than fifty bullocks — even in Mr. 
Wright's time. And he used cake. 
You've sixty-seven and you don't cake. 
You've broken the lease in that respect. 
You'r dragging the heart out of the 
farm. ' 

'I'm — I'm getting some minerals — 
superphosphates— next week. I've as 
good as ordered a truck-load already. 
I'll go down to the station to-morrow 
about 'em. Then I can come and see 
you man to man like, Miss, in the day- 
light. . . . That gentleman's not 
going away, is he?' He almost 
shrieked. 

I had only slid the chair a little farther 
back, reaching behind me to tap on the 
leather of the screen, but he jumped like 
a rat. 

'No. Please attend to me, Mr. 



'THEY' 



72 



Turpin. ' She turned in her chair and 
faced him with his back to the door. 
It was an old and sordid Httle piece of 
scheming that she forced from him — 
his plea for the new cow-shed at his land- 
lady's expense, that he might with the 
covered manure pay his next year's rent 
out of the valuation after, as she made 
clear, he had bled the enriched pastures 
to the bone. I could not but admire 
the intensity of his greed, when I saw 
him out-facing for its sake whatever 
terror it was that ran wet on his fore- 
head. 

I ceased to tap the leather — was, in- 
deed, calculating the cost of the shed — 
when I felt my relaxed hand taken and 
turned softly between the soft hands of 
a child. So at last I had triumphed. 
In a moment I would turn and acquaint 
myself with those quick-footed wan- 
derers. . . . 



•THEY' 73 

The little brushing kiss fell in the 
centre of my palm — as a gift on which 
the fingers were, once, expected to close: 
as the all-faithful half-reproachful sig- 
nal of a waiting child not used to neglect 
even when grown-ups were busiest — a 
fragment of the mute code devised very 
long ago. 

Then I knew. Then it was as though 
I had known from the first day when I 
looked across the lawn at the high 
window. 

I heard the door shut. The woman 
turned to me in silence, and I felt that 
she knew. 

What time passed after this I cannot 
say. I was roused by the fall of a log, 
and mechanically rose to put it back. 
Then I returned to my place in the chair 
very close to the screen. 

'Now you understand, ' she whispered, 
across the packed shadows. 



THEY' 75 

*Yes, I understand — now. Thank 
you.* 

*I — I only hear them. ' She bowed 
her head in her hands. *I have no right, 
you know — no other right. I have 
neither borne nor lost — neither borne 
nor lost!' 

'Be very glad then, * said I, for my 
soul was torn open within me. 

'Forgive me!' 

She was still, and I went back to my 
sorrow and my joy. 

*It was because I loved them so, ' she 
said at last, brokenly. 'That was why 
it was, even from the first — even before 
I knew that they — they were all I should 
ever have. And I loved them so ! ' 

She stretched out her arms to the 
shadows and the shadows within the 
shadow. 

'They came because I loved them — 
because I needed them. I — I must 



'THEY' 76 

have made them come. Was that 
wrong, think you? Did I wrong 
any one ? ' 

•No— no!' 

*I — I grant you that the toys and — ■ 
and all that sort of thing were nonsense, 
but — but I used to so hate empty rooms 
myself when I was little. ' She pointed 
to the gallery. 'And the passages all 
empty. . . . And how could I ever 
bear the garden door shut ? Suppose * 

'Don't ! For pity's sake, don't ! ' I cried. 
The twilight had brought a cold rain with 
gusty squalls that plucked at the leaded 
windows. 

'And the same thing with keeping 
the fire in all night. / don't think it so 
foolish — do you? ' 

I looked at the broad brick hearth; 
saw, through tears I believe, that there 
was no unpassable iron on or near it; 
and bowed my head.

*I did all that and lots of other things 
— just to make believe. Then they came. 
I heard them, but I didn't know that 
they were not mine by right till Mrs. 
Madden told me ' 

The butler's wife ? What ? ' 

'One of them — I heard — she saw. And 
knew. Hers! Not for me. I didn't 
know at first. Perhaps I was jealous. 
Afterwards, I began to understand that 
it was only because I loved them, not 

because . . .Oh, you must bear or 

lose, ' she said piteously. There is no 
other way. And yet they love me. 
They must ! Don't they ? ' 

There was no sound in the room 
except the lapping voices of the fire, but 
we two listened intently, and she, at 
least, took comfort from what she heard.

cried sharply, though I had said 
nothing. 

'Not for you. A thousand times no. 
For you it is right. ... I am grateful 
to you beyond words. For me it would 
be wrong. For me only. . . . * 

'Why?' she said, but passed her hand 
before her face as she had done at oui 
second meeting in the wood. 'Oh, I 
see, ' she went on simply as a child. 'For 
you it would be wrong. * Then with a 
little indrawn laugh, 'and, d'you remem- 
ber, I called you lucky — once — at first.

You who must never come here 
again!' 

She left me to sit a Httle longer by the 
screen, and I heard the sound of her feet 
die out along the gallery above.
